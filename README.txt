Build SCION for Android
=======================

- install Vagrant and VirtualBox
- run "vagrant up" (on Windows, do this from a shell with Administrator rights!)
- executables will be generated in a "jniLibs" directory that can be imported in Android Studio
- after building, run "vagrant halt" (and possibly, "vagrant destroy" because the VM is no more needed)
